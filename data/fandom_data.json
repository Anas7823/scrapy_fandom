According to  , Traci was going to disguise herself as a human and work as a journalist, where she could attempt to “tip the scales in favor of one side or the other\" depending on the player's choices. The artbook also uses the name \"Nathalie\" to refer to her, likely to avoid confusion with the repurposed name.

It is possible that this would have played into her ability to disguise herself for her work as a journalist.  \n Concept art of the Eden Club depicts Traci wearing a lacy black dress and a lingerie set. Later, she is shown wearing a knee-length black coat with heels at Ferndale Station and the Eden Club.      \n Traci's concept art uses the likeness of Israeli-American actress Alona Tal.
